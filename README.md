There is a problem with the default route. /home is the route where the index.html is rendered.

Clone the repository then running the python backend should do it. The index.html has been rendered in:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/home

No changes have been made to the backend or HTML/CSS for the second commit. Only changes have been made in javascript
